<!-- *ngIf="question" directive only renders the element it applies to (in this case, the 'quiz' div) if the condition it's given evaluates to true. -->
<!-- This ensures you won’t access the question if it's not defined; in such cases, the template will render as empty. -->
<div class="quiz" *ngIf="question">
    <!--contains an interpolation, which is a kind of one-way binding-->
    <!--the question is rendered as follows-->
    <h1>{{question.label}}</h1>
    <form [formGroup]="form">
        <div class="form-group">
            <!--ngFor is another directive-->
            <!--It allows you to loop over a collection inside of the template. Here, you use it to render as many radio buttons as there are choices in the question.-->
            <label *ngFor="let choice of question.choices">
                <input type="radio" [value]="choice" formControlName="choice">
                <span>{{choice.value}}</span>
            </label>
        </div>
    </form>
</div>

<!-- In a nutshell, what you’re doing here is wiring up what you defined in the component’s file 
    (the TypeScript file) with some HTML, with the help of Angular's directives and binding syntax. -->
